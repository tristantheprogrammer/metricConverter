Hello everyone! Welcome to my Metric Converter App!

In this app, you are able to convert from one unit to a different unit.

For example, you can convert km to mile, kg to lb, g to oz, and mm to inch.

Make sure to only convert from those units because this app only supports those conversions as of now.

To convert from one unit to another, enter your units in this format: "value unit = desiredUnit"

If I wanted to convert from km to miles, then I would input: "5 km = mile"

If you want to exit the program, enter "-1" or "exit" into the command line.

Have fun using my app!
